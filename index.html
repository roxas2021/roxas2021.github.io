					Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many 
					students define paragraphs in terms of length: a 
					paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, 
					a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, 
					though, the unity and coherence of ideas among 
					sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. 
					A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences 
					or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford 
					and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not 
					determine whether a section in a paper is a 
					paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, 
					particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can 
					be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph 
					is a sentence or group of sentences that support 
					one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to 
					this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls 
					what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
